A quick one-line response, i bet it was copy and pasted. No direction on how to solve it, no helpful tips on what to do, nothing. So seeing as my email didn\\u0027t work, I took time while at work to jump on and speak with a live agent. From the moment we started to speak i could tell i was being rushed through and bothering him with my questions.

Now Samsung is charging me 117.00 to fix a manufacturer issue that they know that causes this watch to malfunction with either battery issues or software issues. Nonetheless I am not happy with Samsung at this moment because I value my electronics and the quality of what I buy from Samsung.

       "                 I have been a Samsung customer for countless years. Since I've purchased my galaxy watch its has had battery issues. They they denied but then fixed. This time coming around I've recently updated my software on my watch and now the watch will not stay on. It just keeps shutting down. Now Samsung is charging me 117.00 to fix a manufacturer issue that they know that causes this watch to malfunction with either battery issues or software issues. Nonetheless I am not happy with Samsung at this moment because I value my electronics and the quality of what I buy from Samsung. This is ridiculous that I I have to pay for a malfunction in their product which they already knows that malfunctioning.\n",

STILL NOT REPAIRED! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!\",\"reviewBody\":\"We\\u0027ve bought a Samsung refrigerator/freezer 11 months ago. A month ago my freezer compartment stopped working. I\\u0027ve reached out to Samsung since we\\u0027re still under the 1 year warranty. They\\u0027ve tried to tell me I wasn\\u0027t covered any longer. I bought it April 8, 2020. It\\u0027s only March 2021. I asked them to do the math. An hour on the phone with Samsung customer service as he was typing up the report only for him to tell me to contact the store I bought it from. I told him I did and they referred me to Samsung as we\\u0027re still covered under the 1 year. He asked me to provide receipt, which I did. It has all the information of my purchased and when item was to be delivered. He than asked if he can see the payment method I used to pay for this. The email confirmation I have shows my order and that it was paid. It didn’t reference how I paid for it, cash/credit etc… What does it matter how I’ve paid? I’VE PAID and item was delivered! An hour and half into the call he finally put in a ticket to have service come out. Upon waiting for the service, I had multiple phone calls from their service center to confirm my appointment. How many times do they actually need to confirm the appointment after I said yes the first time?! A week later, the first tech arrived. He looked at my unit and simple just told me, they will need to have another tech come out here. So now I\\u0027m waiting another 2 weeks! As of yesterday, the second tech came out, looked at the unit, stated it was damaged upon delivery because something inside broke and it would’ve only happened upon transporting the unit. He supposedly did what he called a \\u0022repair\\u0022 and told me to contact Samsung the next day if the unit isn\\u0027t working. Of course the next morning I contacted service and told them the issue, they than transferred me to Samsung. Spoke to someone at Samsung, and as of now I\\u0027m asking for a refund or exchange. Was on the phone with him for a good 45 mins as he was typing up the report only for him to tell me the service dept needs to update the ticket. He tried calling service as I remained on hold for another 15 mins and came back and told me the lines busy he can\\u0027t get through. So he asked me to call them since he can\\u0027t do anything until the tickets been updated. So I called service dept, got through in less than 5 mins, asked them to update the ticket as advised from Samsung. The rep updated the ticket and told me I can call Samsung back now. I called Samsung back and told them ticket has been updated, but of course this time got another rep, Jonathan, who was pretty rude and not understanding at all. He pulled up my ticket and said he needs to call service dept to confirm. Comes back and tells me they will need to send another tech out here to service my unit. At this point I\\u0027ve lost my patience. I\\u0027ve been out of a freezer for a month, my foods are spoiled, I have multiple kids who relay on this unit. He was trying to argue with me and wouldn\\u0027t even let me get a word in. I had to asked him if I can please finish explaining my concern. Of course he didn\\u0027t seem to care at all as to what I was trying to express, he just referred me back to service dept to schedule an appt. I asked to speak to a manager he said he\\u0027ll put in a request to have a supervisor contact me back within the next 48 hrs. So I called service dept AGAIN for 3rd time TODAY to schedule an appt. I explained to the service dept what\\u0027s been going on, but of course all they can say is \\u0022sorry\\u0022 because I\\u0027m sure that\\u0027s what they think I want to hear. I need more than an apology at this point. I need an exchange or a refund. Of course they can\\u0027t do that for me since the service tech didn\\u0027t notate that the unit isn\\u0027t repairable. I than asked, what did the tech notate on the report? To my surprised this was the report, \\u0022Customer refuse repair and will contact Samsung.\\u0022 This frustrated me even more since I\\u0027VE NEVER REFUSED THE REPAIR! I had asked him prior to him leaving my home did he attempt to repair it. He said yes! I\\u0027m beyond upset at the lack of service and how hard it is to just get my unit repaired, exchanged or refunded. I\\u0027m now waiting on another tech to come out NEXT WEEK. Who knows if this will even get repaired. Are they just waiting of my warranty to expire on April 7th? Does Samsung even understand my frustration? I would not recommend Samsung appliance at all. Defected from the start and worst customer service I\\u0027ve ever had to dealt with. NEVER will I ever buy another Samsung appliance ever again!\",\"stars\":1}\n",
