# Opinion Mining
Opinion mining, is a text analysis technique that uses computational linguistics and natural language processing to automatically identify and extract opinion from within text (positive, negative, neutral, etc.).

It allows the stakeholder to get inside your customersâ€™ heads and find out what they like and dislike, and why, so they can create products and services that meet their needs.
It can process thousands of pages, comments or surveys and provide real-time results.

Opinion Mining can be performed by various methods:

1. Social Media Analysis
2. Customer Feedback
3. Customer Service
4. Evaluating Market Campaigns
